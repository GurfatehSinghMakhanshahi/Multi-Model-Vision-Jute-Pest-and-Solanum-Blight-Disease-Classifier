# Multi-Model-Vision-Jute-Pest-and-Solanum-Blight-Disease-Classifier
A CNN detected early/late blight in Solanum crops (tomato/potato) with 95.46% accuracy on 6,658 images. MobileNetV2 identified 17 jute pests with 91% accuracy on 6,443 images. Both models were combined in a Streamlit app for automated disease and pest detection for farmers.
